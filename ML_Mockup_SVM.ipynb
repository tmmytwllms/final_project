        "A Support Vector Machine model is similar to a logistic regression model in that is also a binary classifier, it splits the sample in to two categories; in our data set the two categories being Delayed or Not Delayed. While SVM seeks to split our dataset into two categories, it does not do so as rigorously as a linear regression model. SMV allows for \"soft\" margins and has logic implemented which accounts for outliers and may make exceptions for them. This means some data points past the \"cut off\" line/point may still be sorted into the opposite classification.  \n",
